## Setup

First you should clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mateuszone/Filweb.git
cd  Filmweb
```

To run the project you should have Python 3 installed on your computer. Then it's recommended to create a virtual environment for your projects dependencies. To install virtual environment:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Then run the following command in the project directory:
```
virtualenv venv
```
That will create a new folder venv in your project directory. Next activate virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/active
```
Then install the project dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then create .env file with your local settings such as SECRET_KEY, and your personal OMDB_KEY from https://www.omdbapi.com/ if you want to search for new movies

if you leave settings as they are django will create as default sqlite3 db when you commands below:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Now you can run the project with this command:
```
python manage.py runserver --settings=Filmweb.settings.dev
```

**Note** in the settings file you should complete your own database settings.
